**Beta Preview changes**
1. Mainchain synchronization: added backward transfer support with Withdrawal certificate with threshold signature zero-knowledge proof by using [zendoo-sc-cryptolib](https://github.com/ZencashOfficial/zendoo-sc-cryptolib)
2. Added [Latus Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol](https://www.horizen.global/assets/files/Horizen-Sidechain-Zendoo-A_zk-SNARK-Verifiable-Cross-Chain-Transfer-Protocol.pdf)  for sidechain based on [Ouroboros Praos](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf) consensus protocol which supporting forks in Sidechain and Mainchain. Autoforging for Sidechain node is added as well.
3. Reworked Transactions structure: introduced SidechainCoreTranscation, Boxes structure was improved/changed now two types of boxes are present by default: regular box and forger box. Forger box is used for consensus forger selection.


**Alpha features**
1. Multiple sidechain nodes network.
2. Mainchain synchronization: Cross-chain Transfer Protocol support for sidechain declaration and forward transfers.
3. Basic Consensus (anyone can forge).
4. Built-in coins transferring operations inside sidechain.
5. HTTP API for basic node operations.
6. Possibility to declare custom Transactions/Boxes/Secrets/etc.
7. Possibility to extend/manage basic API.
8. Web interface and command line tool for interaction with the Node.
9. Sidechain Bootstapping Tool to configure sidechain network according to the mainchain network.
